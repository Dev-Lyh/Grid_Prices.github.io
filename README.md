### What I learned

This project don't was hard, because I discover the 'display: grid' in CSS. On begin was confused, but when you 'get' the hang, it's simple.

For fix the template equals in image, I make two columns and the white part, I made it occupy two columns. 

```css
.item1{
    grid-column-start: 1;
    grid-column-end: 3;
}
```

This made it the First column push the two others columns for under it. Later this, was easy. Well... It would have been, if I had view the style_templates before this. I lost 30 minutes in find the correct font, but ok.
